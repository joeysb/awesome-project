<ul>
  <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
  <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
  {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
    <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
  }
</ul>
<p>My skills are:</p>
<ul>
  {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
</ul>
